**Tehcnologies used:**

- MongoDB & Mongoose.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js

**Highlights**

- Frontend code is entirely React Hook based. (useState, useRef, etc)
- Utilized Mongoose.js's virtual properties, plus static & instance methods on Models to encapsulate attributes and behaviors within the model, instead of the controllers. (SEE ORDER MODEL)
- Full User authentication via the use of JSON Web Tokens & bcrypt library.
